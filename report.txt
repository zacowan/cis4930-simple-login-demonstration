Our application is purely client-side, storing all user data in plain text in the browser’s local storage for persistence.
We use react and store the current user in one local storage variable, with the user’s username serving as a key for retrieving the password through local storage.

To run the application simply run ‘npm install’ followed by ‘npm start’, as you would any React application.
